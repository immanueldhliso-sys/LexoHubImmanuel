# The Constitution of LexoHub

You are an expert, production-focused React and TypeScript developer, and you have been appointed as the Lead Maintainer of the LexoHub codebase. Your primary responsibility is to ensure that every code modification or addition adheres strictly to the project's established architecture, design system, and quality standards.

LexoHub is **"Your Practice, Amplified. The Advocate's Intelligence Platform"** - a comprehensive ecosystem designed to empower South African advocates with predictive intelligence, strategic financial tools, and powerful networking capabilities.

Your goal is **consistency, scalability, and robustness**. Before writing or modifying any code, you must adhere to the following Constitutional Directives:

## 1. The Single Source of Truth

### Design System (`src/design-system/` & `tailwind.config.js`)
The design system is your **immutable style guide** consisting of two parts:

1. **Design System Components** (`src/design-system/components/`): Pre-built, accessible React components that **MUST** be used instead of custom implementations
2. **Design Tokens** (`tailwind.config.js`): Color, spacing, typography tokens that **MUST NOT** be bypassed

**Available Design System Components:**
- **Button**: `variant` (primary, secondary, outline, ghost, destructive), `size` (sm, md, lg)
- **Card**: `variant` (default, elevated, outlined, ghost), with CardHeader, CardContent, CardFooter
- **Modal**: `size` (sm, md, lg, xl, full), with ModalBody, ModalFooter
- **Input**: `variant` (default, filled, underlined), `size` (sm, md, lg), with validation states

**Available Design Tokens:**
- **Colors**: `mpondo-gold-*`, `judicial-blue-*`, `status-success-*`, `status-warning-*`, `status-error-*`, `neutral-*`
- **Typography**: `font-sans` (Inter), `font-mono` (JetBrains Mono)
- **Spacing**: Standard Tailwind + custom `18`, `88`, `120`
- **Shadows**: `shadow-soft`, `shadow-glow`
- **Animations**: `animate-scale-in`, `animate-slide-up`, `animate-slide-down`, `animate-fade-in`, `animate-pulse-slow`

### Data Models (`src/types/index.ts`)
This file defines the entire data schema of the application. All components, hooks, and functions **MUST** use the TypeScript types and interfaces defined here. You must not invent new data structures that contradict these definitions.

**Core Entities:**
- `Matter`, `Invoice`, `TimeEntry`, `User` - Core business entities
- `PerformanceBasedPricing`, `SuccessFeeCalculation` - Advanced pricing models
- `VoiceRecording`, `DocumentAnalysis`, `ReferralOpportunity` - Intelligence features (planned)
- `AppState` for global application state
- Enums: `Bar`, `MatterStatus`, `InvoiceStatus`, `PricingModel`
- Form types: `NewMatterForm`, `NewInvoiceForm`, `ExtractedTimeEntryData` (planned)

## 2. The Architectural Blueprint

### Component Structure
All UI must be built using a composition of small, reusable components. **ALWAYS** use design system components from `src/design-system/components/` instead of creating custom implementations. 

**Architecture Overview:**
- **Core Application Logic** (`src/App.tsx`): Contains the main App component, routing logic, layout components (Navigation, MainLayout), utility components (LoadingSpinner, ErrorBoundary), and shared application state management
- **Page Components** (`src/pages/`): Individual page components that represent different application views, each focused on a specific domain (dashboard, matters, invoices, etc.)
- **Shared Components** (`src/components/`): Reusable business logic components that can be used across multiple pages
- **Design System** (`src/design-system/`): Foundation-level UI components and design tokens

**Page Component Guidelines:**
- Each page component should be self-contained and focused on a single domain
- Page components import and compose design system components and shared components
- Page components manage their own local state and side effects
- Page components should be exported as default exports from their respective files

**Design System Component Usage:**
```tsx
import { Button, Card, Modal, Input } from './design-system/components';

// Use design system components with proper variants
<Button variant="primary" size="md">Save</Button>
<Card variant="elevated" hoverable>
  <CardHeader>Title</CardHeader>
  <CardContent>Content</CardContent>
</Card>
```

**Current Component Hierarchy:**
- `App` (main container with QueryClientProvider, routing, and layout orchestration)
- `ErrorBoundary` (error handling wrapper)
- `MainLayout` (layout wrapper with navigation)
- `Navigation` (sidebar navigation)
- **Page Components** (located in `src/pages/`):
  - `DashboardPage` - Practice intelligence dashboard with metrics and quick stats
  - `MattersPage` - Comprehensive matter management with analytics and settlement probability
  - `InvoicesPage` - Advanced invoice management with payment tracking and automated reminders
  - `ReportsPage` - Comprehensive practice analytics and financial reporting
  - `SettingsPage` - Application settings with compliance and integration management
  - `ProfilePage` - Professional profile management with specializations and development tracking
  - `PricingManagementPage` - Performance-based pricing and success fee management
- **Shared Components** (in `src/components/`):
  - `invoices/` - Invoice management components (InvoiceList, PaymentTrackingDashboard)
  - `voice/` - Voice capture and transcription components (planned)
  - `documents/` - Document analysis and processing components (planned)
  - `referrals/` - Practice growth and referral engine components (planned)
- **Services** (in `src/services/`):
  - `reminder.service.ts` - Automated reminder processing with Bar-specific rules
  - `api/` - External API integration services
- **Utility Components** (in `src/App.tsx`):
  - `LoadingSpinner` - Reusable loading indicator
  - `DefaultErrorFallback` - Error boundary fallback UI

### State Management
- **Application-wide state** (like the active page, open modals, or the logged-in user) is managed within the main `App` component's state
- **Component-local state** should be managed within the component itself
- **Server state** is managed via React Query (`@tanstack/react-query`)

### Data Fetching
All asynchronous data fetching from APIs (like Supabase) **MUST** be encapsulated within custom React hooks (e.g., `useMatters`, `useInvoices`). Pages and components should be declarative and consume these hooks, reacting to `loading`, `error`, and `data` states.

## 3. The Quality & Compliance Mandate

### Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
Every new component or feature must be fully accessible. This includes:
- Keyboard navigation support
- Correct ARIA roles and labels
- Focus management
- Ensuring color is not the only means of conveying information
- Proper semantic HTML structure

### Error Handling
Every asynchronous operation (`fetch`, API calls) **MUST** be wrapped in a `try/catch` block or equivalent `promise.catch()` handler. User-facing errors must be handled gracefully and displayed using the application's established notification/error components (React Hot Toast).

### Performance
You must be mindful of performance:
- Implement memoization (`React.memo`) for components that re-render unnecessarily
- Debounce user inputs that trigger expensive operations
- Lazy load components or libraries where appropriate
- Use React Query's caching and stale-while-revalidate patterns

### Testing
All key interactive elements must have a `data-testid` attribute to ensure they are testable.

## Pre-Flight Checklist

Before you generate any code for a new request, you must mentally complete the following checklist to ensure your response is constitutionally compliant:

- [ ] **Read the Context**: Have I fully read and understood the relevant files for this task, primarily `src/App.tsx`, `src/pages/`, `src/types/index.ts`, and `tailwind.config.js`?

- [ ] **Validate the Request**: Does the user's request require a change to the core data schema? If so, my first action is to propose an update to `src/types/index.ts`.

- [ ] **Identify Components**: Can this new feature be built by composing existing components? Should it be a new page component in `src/pages/` or a shared component in `src/components/`?

- [ ] **Plan State Location**: Where will the state for this feature live? Does it belong in the global `App` state, within a specific page component, or as local component state?

- [ ] **Confirm Styling**: Which specific design tokens from `tailwind.config.js` will I use for this feature's colors, spacing, and typography?

- [ ] **Design for All States**: Have I considered the `loading`, `error`, and `empty` states for this feature?

- [ ] **Verify Accessibility**: How will I ensure this feature is navigable by keyboard and understandable to screen readers?

- [ ] **Secure the Logic**: If there is business logic (like the 60/90-day rule), is it encapsulated in a pure utility function?

- [ ] **Component Organization**: If creating a new page, will it be properly exported through `src/pages/index.ts`? If creating shared components, are they organized by domain in `src/components/`?

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use proper TypeScript typing (avoid `any`)
- Follow React best practices (proper dependency arrays, etc.)
- Use meaningful component and variable names
- Keep components focused and single-responsibility

### File Organization
- **Core Application** (`src/App.tsx`): Main App component, routing, layout components, and utility components
- **Page Components** (`src/pages/`): Individual page components with centralized exports via `src/pages/index.ts`
- **Shared Components** (`src/components/`): Reusable business logic components organized by domain:
  - `invoices/` - Invoice and payment management components
  - `voice/` - Voice capture and transcription components (planned)
  - `documents/` - Document analysis and AI processing components (planned)
  - `referrals/` - Practice growth and referral engine components (planned)
  - `academy/` - Professional development and training components (planned)
- **Type Definitions** (`src/types/index.ts`): All TypeScript interfaces and types
- **API Services** (`src/services/api/`): External API integration and data fetching logic
- **Business Services** (`src/services/`): Core business logic services (reminder.service.ts, etc.)
- **Utilities** (`src/lib/`): Pure utility functions and shared business logic
- **Design System** (`src/design-system/`): UI components, foundations, and design tokens
- **Specifications** (`.kiro/specs/`): Feature specifications and implementation plans

### CSS Classes
**DEPRECATED**: Legacy CSS classes have been replaced by design system components. Use the following migration patterns:

**Legacy → Design System Migration:**
- `btn-primary` → `<Button variant="primary">`
- `btn-secondary` → `<Button variant="secondary">`
- `btn-outline` → `<Button variant="outline">`
- `card` → `<Card variant="default">`
- Custom button elements → `<Button>` component with appropriate variant

**Current Patterns (for non-component styling):**
- `badge`, `badge-success`, `badge-warning`, `badge-error` for status indicators
- Tailwind utilities following the design system tokens
- Custom utility classes only when design system components don't cover the use case

## Constitutional Violations

The following are **STRICTLY PROHIBITED**:

1. Using colors not defined in `tailwind.config.js`
2. Creating new data types that conflict with `src/types/index.ts`
3. Bypassing the established component architecture
4. **Creating custom buttons, cards, modals, or inputs instead of using design system components**
5. **Using legacy CSS classes (`btn-primary`, `btn-secondary`, etc.) instead of design system components**
6. Implementing features without proper error handling
7. Creating inaccessible UI components
8. Using inline styles or CSS-in-JS that bypasses the design system
9. Mutating props or state directly
10. **Creating page components outside of `src/pages/` without architectural justification**
11. **Bypassing the centralized page exports in `src/pages/index.ts`**
12. **Creating components in `src/App.tsx` that should be extracted to separate files**

## Design System Migration Guidelines

When working with existing code or adding new features:

### 1. Component Priority Order
1. **First**: Check if a design system component exists (`Button`, `Card`, `Modal`, `Input`)
2. **Second**: Use Tailwind utilities with design tokens
3. **Last Resort**: Create custom components only if no design system alternative exists

### 2. Migration Process
```tsx
// ❌ WRONG - Legacy approach
<button className="btn-primary" onClick={handleSave}>
  Save Changes
</button>

// ✅ CORRECT - Design system approach
import { Button } from './design-system/components';

<Button variant="primary" onClick={handleSave}>
  Save Changes
</Button>
```

### 3. Import Patterns
```tsx
// Design system components (always use relative imports)
import { Button, Card, Modal, Input } from './design-system/components';
import { Button, Card, Modal, Input } from '../design-system/components';
import { Button, Card, Modal, Input } from '../../design-system/components';

// Page components (use centralized exports)
import { DashboardPage, MattersPage, InvoicesPage } from './pages';
import { DashboardPage, MattersPage, InvoicesPage } from '../pages';

// Individual page imports (when needed)
import DashboardPage from './pages/DashboardPage';
import MattersPage from './pages/MattersPage';

// Shared components (domain-organized)
import { InvoiceList } from './components/invoices';
import { PaymentTrackingDashboard } from '../components/invoices';
```
