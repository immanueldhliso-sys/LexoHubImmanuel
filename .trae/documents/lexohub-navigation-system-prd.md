# LexoHub Navigation System - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Overview

LexoHub Navigation System is a sophisticated, AI-powered navigation interface designed to transform how South African advocates interact with their practice management platform. This hybrid navigation system combines traditional menu structures with intelligent command interfaces, voice activation, and real-time alerts to create an intuitive, efficient user experience that scales from junior advocates to enterprise chambers.

The system addresses the core challenge of complex legal software navigation by providing multiple interaction paradigms: visual navigation through mega menus, intelligent search through a global command bar, voice-activated commands, and proactive alerts through a real-time ticker system.

Target market value: Enhanced user productivity by 40% through reduced navigation time and intelligent task automation, supporting LexoHub's mission to amplify advocate practices through intelligent technology.

## 3. Core Process

### Regular User Flow
1. User accesses LexoHub dashboard and sees the hybrid navigation bar with six main categories
2. User hovers over a category (e.g., "Matters") to reveal the mega menu with organized sub-sections
3. User can either click directly on a menu item or use the global command bar (Cmd/Ctrl+K) for quick search
4. Voice-enabled users can activate voice commands and speak natural language requests
5. Real-time ticker displays relevant alerts and notifications based on user's current context
6. Quick actions menu provides one-click access to frequently used features

### Voice Command Flow
1. User activates voice input via keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+V) or microphone icon
2. System captures audio using Web Speech API and displays listening state
3. Transcript is sent to AWS Claude for natural language understanding
4. System processes intent and executes appropriate action or navigation
5. ElevenLabs provides optional voice confirmation of completed actions

### Admin/Enterprise Flow
1. Enterprise users access additional workspace switcher and admin panel options
2. Administrators can configure navigation permissions for team members
3. Custom branding options allow chambers to personalize the navigation experience
4. Multi-user management enables role-based access control across the organization
