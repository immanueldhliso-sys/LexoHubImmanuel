# Voice-First Time Capture - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Voice-First Time Capture feature enables advocates to dictate time entries and file notes on the go using natural language processing. This feature transforms the traditional time tracking experience by allowing hands-free, conversational input that automatically structures and categorizes legal work.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Voice Recording and Transcription

**User Story:** As an advocate, I want to record voice notes for time entries so that I can capture billable work without interrupting my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the voice capture button THEN the system SHALL start recording audio
2. WHEN the user speaks into the microphone THEN the system SHALL display real-time audio level indicators
3. WHEN the user stops recording THEN the system SHALL automatically transcribe the audio to text
4. WHEN transcription is complete THEN the system SHALL display the transcribed text for review
5. IF the transcription fails THEN the system SHALL provide an option to retry or manually enter text
6. WHEN the user is recording THEN the system SHALL show recording duration and provide stop/pause controls

### Requirement 2: Natural Language Processing for Time Entries

**User Story:** As an advocate, I want the system to automatically extract time entry details from my voice notes so that I don't have to manually structure the information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user dictates a time entry THEN the system SHALL extract the matter reference or client name
2. WHEN the user mentions duration (e.g., "2 hours", "30 minutes") THEN the system SHALL parse and set the time duration
3. WHEN the user describes work performed THEN the system SHALL categorize it into appropriate work types
4. WHEN the user mentions a date THEN the system SHALL set the correct date for the time entry
5. IF no date is mentioned THEN the system SHALL default to the current date
6. WHEN parsing is complete THEN the system SHALL populate a time entry form with extracted data

### Requirement 3: Matter Association and Context

**User Story:** As an advocate, I want the system to automatically associate my voice notes with the correct matter so that time is tracked accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user mentions a client name THEN the system SHALL search for matching active matters
2. WHEN multiple matters match THEN the system SHALL present options for user selection
3. WHEN the user mentions a matter reference number THEN the system SHALL directly associate the entry
4. IF no matter is found THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to select from a list or create a new matter
5. WHEN a matter is selected THEN the system SHALL validate the user has access to that matter

### Requirement 4: Voice Note Management

**User Story:** As an advocate, I want to manage my voice recordings and transcriptions so that I can review and organize my captured work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a voice note is created THEN the system SHALL save both the audio file and transcription
2. WHEN the user views voice notes THEN the system SHALL display a chronological list with timestamps
3. WHEN the user clicks on a voice note THEN the system SHALL allow playback of the original audio
4. WHEN the user edits a transcription THEN the system SHALL save the changes and mark as manually edited
5. WHEN the user deletes a voice note THEN the system SHALL remove both audio and transcription data
6. WHEN voice notes are converted to time entries THEN the system SHALL mark them as processed

### Requirement 5: Multi-language Support

**User Story:** As an advocate, I want to dictate in my preferred language so that I can work naturally in Afrikaans or English.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a language preference THEN the system SHALL use that language for transcription
2. WHEN the system detects speech THEN it SHALL automatically identify the language being spoken
3. WHEN transcribing Afrikaans THEN the system SHALL handle legal terminology correctly
4. WHEN transcribing English THEN the system SHALL handle South African legal terms and pronunciations
5. IF language detection is uncertain THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to confirm the language

### Requirement 6: Offline Capability

**User Story:** As an advocate, I want to record voice notes even when offline so that I can capture time entries in any location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is offline THEN the system SHALL still allow voice recording
2. WHEN offline recordings are made THEN the system SHALL queue them for processing when online
3. WHEN the device comes online THEN the system SHALL automatically process queued recordings
4. WHEN processing queued items THEN the system SHALL show progress and notify of completion
5. IF offline storage is full THEN the system SHALL warn the user and suggest syncing

### Requirement 7: Integration with Time Entry System

**User Story:** As an advocate, I want voice-captured time entries to integrate seamlessly with my existing time tracking so that all my work is recorded consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a voice note is processed THEN the system SHALL create a draft time entry
2. WHEN the time entry is created THEN it SHALL follow the same validation rules as manual entries
3. WHEN the user reviews the draft THEN they SHALL be able to edit all fields before saving
4. WHEN the time entry is saved THEN it SHALL appear in the standard time entry list
5. WHEN calculating billable amounts THEN voice-captured entries SHALL use the same rate calculations

### Requirement 8: Privacy and Security

**User Story:** As an advocate, I want my voice recordings to be secure and private so that client confidentiality is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN voice data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL use end-to-end encryption
2. WHEN voice files are stored THEN they SHALL be encrypted at rest
3. WHEN transcription occurs THEN it SHALL happen on secure servers with data residency compliance
4. WHEN voice data is no longer needed THEN the system SHALL automatically delete it after a configurable period
5. IF the user requests data deletion THEN the system SHALL permanently remove all associated voice data
6. WHEN accessing voice features THEN the system SHALL require appropriate authentication
