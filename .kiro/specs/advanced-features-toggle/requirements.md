# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a settings-based toggle system that allows users to manually enable advanced/optional pages in the Lexo application. By default, these specialized features will be hidden to simplify the initial user experience, but users can enable them when they're ready to use more advanced functionality. This approach reduces cognitive load for new users while preserving access to powerful features for experienced users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want the application interface to be simplified by default, so that I can focus on core functionality without being overwhelmed by advanced features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user first accesses the application THEN the system SHALL hide advanced pages by default
2. WHEN advanced pages are disabled THEN the system SHALL NOT display navigation links or menu items for these pages
3. WHEN advanced pages are disabled THEN the system SHALL NOT allow direct URL access to these pages
4. IF a user attempts to access a disabled advanced page via URL THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the dashboard with an informational message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an experienced user, I want to enable advanced features through settings, so that I can access specialized tools when I need them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the settings page THEN the system SHALL display an "Advanced Features" section
2. WHEN viewing advanced features settings THEN the system SHALL show toggle switches for each advanced page category
3. WHEN a user enables an advanced feature toggle THEN the system SHALL immediately make that feature accessible in the navigation
4. WHEN a user disables an advanced feature toggle THEN the system SHALL immediately hide that feature from the navigation
5. WHEN feature toggles are changed THEN the system SHALL persist these preferences to the user's profile

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see clear categorization of advanced features, so that I can understand what each toggle enables.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing advanced features settings THEN the system SHALL group features into logical categories: "Financial & Growth Tools", "AI & Document Intelligence", and "Professional Development & Workflow"
2. WHEN displaying each feature toggle THEN the system SHALL show the feature name, brief description, and current status
3. WHEN hovering over a feature toggle THEN the system SHALL display additional information about what pages/functionality it enables
4. WHEN a category has multiple related features THEN the system SHALL provide a "Enable All" option for that category

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my advanced feature preferences to be remembered across sessions, so that I don't have to reconfigure them each time I use the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enables or disables advanced features THEN the system SHALL save these preferences to their user profile
2. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL load their saved advanced feature preferences
3. WHEN preferences are loaded THEN the system SHALL apply the correct navigation and page access permissions
4. IF no saved preferences exist THEN the system SHALL use the default disabled state for all advanced features

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be notified about available advanced features, so that I can discover functionality I might find useful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has been using the application for 7 days THEN the system SHALL show a non-intrusive notification about advanced features
2. WHEN displaying the notification THEN the system SHALL include a direct link to the advanced features settings
3. WHEN a user dismisses the notification THEN the system SHALL not show it again for that user
4. WHEN a user clicks the notification THEN the system SHALL navigate to the settings page with the advanced features section highlighted

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to see usage analytics for advanced features, so that I can understand which features are most valuable to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enables an advanced feature THEN the system SHALL log this event with timestamp and user ID
2. WHEN a user accesses an enabled advanced page THEN the system SHALL track page usage analytics
3. WHEN generating usage reports THEN the system SHALL include advanced feature adoption and usage metrics
4. WHEN an advanced feature is rarely used THEN the system SHALL flag it for potential UX improvements
